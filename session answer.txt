question 5:-A library charges fine for late return of books. For first 5 days, fine charged is 2Rs/day, for 6­10 days it is Rs 3/day and above 10 days 
it is 7Rs/day. If book is not returned for 30 days, fine will be charged and membership for library is also cancelled. Accept the student­id and number
of late days for a student, print the fine paid by
asnwer:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int id,day;
    printf("Enter Student ID:");
    scanf("%d",&id);
    printf("enter number of late days:");
    scanf("%d",&day);
    if(day<=5){
        printf("fine is %d",2*day);
    }
    else if(11>day && day>5){
        printf("fine is %d",(2*5)+(3*(day-5)));
    }
    else if(30>day && day>10){
        printf("fine is %d",25+(7*(day-10)));
    }
    else{
        printf("%d membership for library cancelled and fine is 165",id);
    }
    return 0;
}
